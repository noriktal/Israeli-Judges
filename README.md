## About the Project

This is a partial first draft of a website presenting a database of sociological data of Israeli Judges (since 1948 until 2016 for this draft).

Collection of data for the database was conduced as part of Alon Jasper's MA thesis in Law (supervisor: Yishai Blank). The database is being updated these days.

The website is being built by Michal Tal-Socher.
